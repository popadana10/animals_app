                In this React application, I've curated a collection of animal profiles. Users can interact by liking or removing animals, and there's a convenient search feature for finding specific ones. <br />It's a comprehensive way to explore various creatures from the comfort of your browser. The animals are neatly categorized, making navigation intuitive. Clicking on any animal reveals detailed information, complemented by a handy back button for easy browsing.

                What sets this app apart is the integration of Wikipedia excerpts, providing enriching insights into each animal. It's a blend of entertainment and education!

                Throughout this project, I've honed my skills in React routing, prop management, and navigation implementation. Deploying the app to GitHub Pages was a valuable learning experience that enhanced my understanding of project deployment.
